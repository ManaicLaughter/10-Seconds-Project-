A list of quick crazy python projects that can be built within 10 Seconds.

## The Screen Prank
In the project we have used python's rotate screen module to create a simple program that rotates screen 90 Degree in loop.

A small code to print our childhood's famous XOXO game grid in python window. I will refactor this later into fully functional XOXO game.
